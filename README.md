Welcome to SharpBeat repository! This project aims to provide a frontend
application for a music streaming application using the F# programming
language and Avalonia framework. It allows you to manage songs and playlists.

This application is hardcoded to work with [zSnails/plyr](https://github.com/zSnails/plyr)
music server. As part of a project for my Programming Languages course at Costa Rica 
Institute of Technology.
